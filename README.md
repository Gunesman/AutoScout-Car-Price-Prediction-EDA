# AutoScout Car Price Prediction EDA

## Project Overview
The "AutoScout Car Price Prediction EDA" project is an exploratory data analysis initiative focusing on car price prediction using a dataset scraped from an online car trading platform in 2022. The dataset encompasses 13 car makes, 594 models, and various features, offering a rich source for data exploration and cleaning. This project serves as a bridge between the Data Analysis and Data Visualization courses, with successful completion being a prerequisite for certification.

The primary objectives of the project are:
- To practice and enhance skills in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis.
- To prepare a clean and well-structured dataset suitable for predictive modeling in future machine learning projects.
- To solidify Python programming skills by using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy.

The project culminates in pushing the solution to a GitHub repository, showcasing the analysis as part of a professional portfolio.

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Cleaning
The first stage focuses on preparing the dataset by addressing:
- **Incorrect Headers:** Renaming columns for clarity and consistency.
- **Incorrect Formats:** Standardizing data types across columns.
- **Anomalies:** Identifying and addressing inconsistencies in the data.
- **Dropping Useless Columns:** Removing irrelevant or redundant features to streamline analysis.

### 2. Handling Missing Values (Imputation)
This stage involves:
- Filling missing values for both categorical and numerical features.
- Employing imputation techniques to ensure data completeness without compromising integrity.
- Transforming categorical data into numerical form through encoding for compatibility with analysis and modeling tools.

### 3. Handling Outliers
The third stage leverages visualization techniques to:
- Identify outliers using statistical and graphical methods.
- Extract meaningful insights by exploring relationships between variables.
- Make informed decisions about retaining, transforming, or removing outliers based on their impact on the dataset.
